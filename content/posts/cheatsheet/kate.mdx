## Fixing Kate's 'save session' bug

If Kate is not saving sessions

Make sure the active user own all files under <code>.kde</code>
```shell
sudo chown -R username:username /home/username/.kde
```

Open ~/.kde/share/config/katerc and verify if these are in there:

```
[General] 
Last Session=mysession.katesession 
Restore Window Configuration=true 
Session Exit=save
```

*Note*: There has been a long outstanding bug where sometimes some of the settings are not properly saved.
