**PouchDB Server** is a drop-in replacement for CouchDB, using PouchDB and Node.js. **Termux** is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required.
With the ability to run a linux terminal on Android, we can get a running instance of PouchDB Server on it.

### Goal

Having a PouchDB Server running on your Android phone.

### What you will need
An Android phone with [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&amp;hl=en_US) installed

### Instructions

At the command line in Termux, run the commands below in the following order:

```bash
pkg install python
pkg install nodejs
npm -g install node-gyp
npm install -g pouchdb-server
```

*A ton of warnings and errors may pop up. These can be ignored as long as we get it up and running successfully.*

Finally, run:
```bash
pouchdb-server --sqlite
```

If it didn't work, install SQLite:
```bash
pkg install sqlite
```

If all goes well, the PouchDB Server admin interface should be available at <code>http://localhost:5984/_utils</code>, in any browser on your phone:

#### Some finishing notes
* *At first, PouchDB Server will only be available locally. To enable access from other devices connected to the same network access point, change configuration setting httpd bind_address to 0.0.0.0*

* *It starts in admin party-mode (no authentication = open to any one editing.). Be sure to create an admin user if the server is made available on the network to prevent unintended access.*
